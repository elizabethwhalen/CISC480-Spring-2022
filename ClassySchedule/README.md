# ClassySchedule

1. Ensure that you are in the ClassySchedule subdirectory
2. Make sure you are using Java 14 (Gradlew should do 
   this automatically during the build but if there are
   issues this might be the reason)
3. Run "gradlew clean build" from terminal
4. Configuration and everything should be ready to go

All resources should be placed in the src/main/java/resources folder

If we need to add more dependencies, we can do that

Talk to Daniel if something doesn't work.
