# ClassySchedule

1. Ensure that you are in the ClassySchedule subdirectory
2. Run "gradlew clean build" from terminal
3. Configuration and everything should be ready to go

All resources should be placed in the src/main/java/resources folder

If we need to add more dependencies, we can do that

Talk to Daniel if something doesn't work.
